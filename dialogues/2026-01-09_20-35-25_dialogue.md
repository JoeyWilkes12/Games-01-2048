Using Claude Opus 4.5 Thinking : Reason & Review tests since there appears to be failures. lets also create individual playwright tests that are shorter and can be run in parallel & so that we ccan hopefully have diverse methods of testing the application & game so that we can more precisely debug. 

- [ ]  Lets keep the playwright demo test capability for when we want to have one recording that demo’s the entire app. but we also want individual recording scripts that can be run in parallel and allow for more granular testing. We can start with at least 1 per game. We want to leverage playwright parallelism (https://playwright.dev/docs/test-parallel ) and we want to be able to have a parameter in the terminal command that can control how fast the navigation goes (add this clarification to tests.md). We also want to be able to wrap arguments into an object because the standard output is throwing these warnings:
- ⚠️ Skipping "2048 demo" due to error: Too many arguments. If you need to pass more than 1 argument to the function wrap them in an object.
- **⚠️ Skipping "Random Event Dice demo" due to error: Too many arguments. If you need to pass more than 1 argument to the function wrap them in an object.
- also add a parameter so that the test is not headless and I can see it navigating the browser running the test, but the default can be headless (or however it is now) if thats feasible.**

You may complete these tasks either after completing the primary modifications or as you go if you anticipate not being able to complete everything in one-shot execution: 
- Upon completion of these modifications, write additional tests using seed & specific setting configurations. You can also review JSON other files associated with testing.
- Regarding new tests, always review the [run-all-tests.sh](http://run-all-tests.sh/) script to ensure it encapsulates all the latests tests & is the most broad & complete source for testing.
- Update readmes & documentation.
- Before the end of your execution, commit changes locally.
It is vital that if for context purposes, you are unable to complete all of these tasks, always locally commit your changes, update the tasks for the future so you could pick up where you left off given additional execution time & context, and be explicit when reporting back to the user what the plan is for continuity.
