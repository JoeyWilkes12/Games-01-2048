What Was Done
1. Branch Analysis
Analyzed commit history and diffs to identify:

22 files changed in dice branch (testing infrastructure)
10 files changed in bank branch (Bank game)
5 overlapping files requiring resolution
2. Merge Execution
git checkout -b merge-consolidation-2026-01-09
git merge origin/dice_enhancements_03_gemini3_pro_high  # Fast-forward
git merge origin/v3.1.0_bank_base_functionality_UI      # 2 conflicts
3. Conflict Resolution
File	Resolution

run-all-tests.sh
Combined dice infrastructure (--headed, --speed, --split) + Bank tests

tests.md
Used dice docs as base, added Bank test documentation

# Run parallel demos
./run-all-tests.sh --split
# With speed modifier (2x faster)
./run-all-tests.sh --split --speed=2.0
# With visible browser (headed mode)
./run-all-tests.sh --split --headed
3. Full Demo Recording
A complete sequential walkthrough of the entire application.

# Run full demo (slower, sequential)
./run-all-tests.sh --demo

Command-Line Options
Option	Description
--tests	Run unit/seeded tests only
--split	Run split demo tests (parallel)
--demo	Run full demo recording (sequential)
--all	Run all tests (tests + split + demo)
--headed	Run in visible browser mode
--speed=N	Speed multiplier (e.g., --speed=2.0 for 2x faster)
--report	Open HTML report after tests
Speed Control
The --speed parameter controls how fast demos navigate:

--speed=0.5 - Half speed (slower, better for debugging)
--speed=1.0 - Normal speed (default)
--speed=2.0 - Double speed (faster)
--speed=4.0 - Quadruple speed (fastest, may miss visual details)
Examples
# Quick verification (default: tests + split)
./run-all-tests.sh
# Full verification with visible browser
./run-all-tests.sh --all --headed
# Fast parallel demos
./run-all-tests.sh --split --speed=2.0
# Debug a specific game demo
DEMO_SPEED=0.5 npx playwright test tests/demo-red.spec.js --project=split-demos --headed

Playwright Parallelism
The split-demos project is configured for parallel execution:

// playwright.config.js
{
  name: 'split-demos',
  testDir: './tests',
  fullyParallel: true,
  workers: 3,  // Run 3 game demos simultaneously
  // ...
}
See Playwright Parallelism Docs for more details.

Troubleshooting
"No tests found" Error
Ensure you're using the correct project name:

npx playwright test tests/ --project=split-demos
Timeout Errors
Reduce demo speed or increase timeout:

DEMO_SPEED=0.5 npx playwright test tests/demo-red.spec.js --project=split-demos
"Too many arguments" Error
Ensure page.evaluate() calls wrap arguments in an object:

// ❌ Wrong
await page.evaluate((y, selector) => { ... }, pos, container);
<<<<<<< HEAD
// ✅ Correct
await page.evaluate(({ y, selector }) => { ... }, { y: pos, selector: container });
